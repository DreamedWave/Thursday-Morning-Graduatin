HELLO THERE!
Thanks for downloading Thursday Mornin Graduatin'.
This is a Friday Night Funkin' MOD, meaning that I didn't create all this fancy code, I just modified a modified version of the game known as "Kade Engine". The version of Kade Engine being used is "Ver 1.6".

That doesn't mean I didn't do anything though, I changed and overhauled alot of stuff, too graphic and code wise such as removing crashes, adding features, adding assets, and new screens/mechanics. (INTRODUCING THE DREAMED ENGI- [gets shot])

Now with that out of the way....
HAVE FUN AND ENJOY!

    PERMISSIONS AND PRIVACY STUFF
#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-

The original game is open-source and has a "Creative Commons" license.

HOWEVER, this mod contains images that when spread around as a FNF mod, may break a Privacy Law or two. It also is just disrespectful to the people, as this being made "just for good fun" would ultimately be questioned when this is a publically available out-in-the-open FNF Mod.

So I kindly ask you, player who has this game either because you're a close friend, a classmate, or a person who isn't supposed to see this but have it anyway cause someone didn't take the time to reAD ThE fRICKiNg DiSCLAIMER--
to not upload/share this to anyone else. No screenshots, no videos, no download links, NOTHING.

If ever you don't pay attention to, or don't care and want to disrespect the privacy rights and/or reputation of some priest, some dude who happened to be near him, and a 16 year old (as of writing) who thought it would be funny to make a full-ass mod of a game he finds entertaining, then it's no biggie, just fuck you I hate you I cut your dick off and eat your pancreas but like, no biggie.

[>-|o]   Fred is sleeping shhh do  not wake    them.

If you don't have any intention of spreading the game, and just want another wacky FNF mod or game to play, well then go ahead! Have fun and enjoy!

The same cannot be said for the music, however, I MADE THEM, AND I AS THE CREATOR, I HAVE DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH THE WOOORLLLDDD~!!! (Via Bandcamp. Youtube might come soon but Idk)
