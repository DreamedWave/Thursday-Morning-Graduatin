Basically I had a different story before, it was bare bones and was basically "oh graduation but they become FNF". I changed it to be less literal than that and I hope it turned out well

OLD Story flow: 
>Everything normal
>Daddy dearest from FNF shows up
>They fight and he loses. they get dragged into the border
>They pray but then it becomes an argument and then they fight until settling on their differences (hence why I thought 'Retaliation' didn't fit the tone of the story before it changed)
>They walk around and find a crack and teleport to the City
>They fight pico and then defeat him
>He leaves them alone and they go to the tall building in the bg of the city
>It contains the "FUNKIN' CORE" and it should help them get home
>But priest takes it for himself and then becomes the final boss
>They fight epicly and then they return home
>Turns out priest was possesed when they went to the border
>The funkin core freed them and now they happy

I mean I can see how this could be turned into a great thing but like I kinda like the darker twist I thought of recently. Hopefully it doesn't fall flat on it's face--
