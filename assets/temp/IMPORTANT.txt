Hello, if you are reading this please don't put any files in this folder, especially the important ones, just DON'T at all costs unless you want those files to have a risk of being DELETED.

This folder automatically clears itself after you exit the results screen, the charting state (only clears stuff within '/_autosavedCharts'), or the game itself. I coded in some stuff to make sure that it only deletes autosaves and replay data but we can never be too sure!

So go have fun, play the game, and snoop around the files! Just DON'T put your VERY IMPORTANT research within this folder, or else it has a chance of being deleted if my code is wrong, like gonezo. kapoof. zilch.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, OK BYEEEEEE~!
