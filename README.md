# Thursday Morning Graduatin'
**Thursday Morning Graduatin'** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' that was originally created as a joke making fun of a scuffed graduation, but later turned into it's own thing featuring an original story, and cast of characters that are very much *NOT* connected to Friday Night Funkin'. Based on a lot of Friday Night Funkin mods, but mainly the 1.6 version of Kade Engine, which was *HEAVILY* modified to improve some things and remove some bloat.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod** and is not associated with KadeDev or The Funkin' Crew. This was just created *PURELY* for fun by 1 person!

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can set any keybinds you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your speakers or headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended!
 - **And much, much more!**
	 - There's so much more in store than just what's listed here! If you can imagine a quality of life feature, it's probably
	 either already included in Kade Engine or is being worked on!
