# Thursday Morning Graduatin' (Cancelled)
**Thursday Morning Graduatin'** was a mod for Friday Night Funkin' that was created by [me](https://en.pronouns.page/@AmieeWuzHere) initially as a joke making fun of my scuffed graduation, but eventually evolved into a bigger project that ended up being too ambitious to be worked on. It was built from the 1.6 version of Kade Engine that was heavily modified.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod** and is not associated with KadeDev or The Funkin' Crew. This was just created *PURELY* for fun by someone who was willing to dedicate 3 years of her life to a shitpost! Also like, I'm NOT a coder, so I'm warning *YOU* in advance, the source code may make any coders reading it weep, scream, and cry.

To find out how to be able to build this mod, click [this](https://github.com/DreamedWave/Thursday-Morning-Graduatin/blob/main/BUILDING-GUIDE.md)!

# Current Freatures:
 - **Adaptive Music**
      - Most of the playable story mode songs change and react to how well you're doing!
      - For example: some tracks' instrumentals become more suspenseful the more your health lowers.
 - **Quality of Life additions**
      - Note Hit Sounds! (for both normal and hold notes - akin to that of osu's)
      - A visual and auditory cue for when you break a combo! (to avoid beating a level thinking you Full Combo'd it, only to see that you missed 1 note somewhere... yeowch)
      - Night Mode and Photosensitive Mode!
 - **A few Backend Fixins/Rewrites**
<br></br>

# Prevously Planned Features:
 - *[tba]* **6 or so playable 'Weeks' (which are called 'Parts' in this mod)**
 - *[tba]* **Custom game mechanics**
 - *[tba]* **An *actual* Tutorial Level**
 - *[tba]* **Unlockable Freeplay Songs**
 - *[tba]* **Custom scoring and ranking system**
