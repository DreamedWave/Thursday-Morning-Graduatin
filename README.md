# Thursday Morning Graduatin'
**Thursday Morning Graduatin'** is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' that was initially created by [DreamedWave](https://github.com/DreamedWave) as a joke making fun of her scuffed graduationte, but eventually evolved into a bigger project featuring some new mechanics, an overarching original story, and a mostly new cast of characters that are very much *NOT* connected to the story of Friday Night Funkin' in any way. Based on the 1.6 version of Kade Engine, which was *HEAVILY* modified to improve/add some things and remove some bloat.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod** and is not associated with KadeDev or The Funkin' Crew. This was just created *PURELY* for fun by someone who was willing to dedicate 3 years of her life to a shitpost!!

# What You Can Expect:
 - **6 or so playable 'Weeks' (which are called 'Parts' in this mod)**
      - All containing 3 or more songs, each fully charted in all difficulties (Easy, Normal, and Hard)!
 - **Custom game mechanics**
      - Some 'Weeks' change up the formula a little bit, and adds a few new mechanics that builds upon Friday Night Funkin's gameplay without jeopardizing it!
 - *[to be added]* **An *actual* Tutorial Level**
      - That teaches any new players how to play without 100 or so lines of text!
 - **More unlockable Freeplay Songs**
      - Aside from all the songs within every 'Week', there will be more songs available for you to find and unlock within Freeplay!
 - **Adaptive Music**
      - Most to playable story mode songs change and react to how well you're doing!
      - For example: some tracks' instrumentals become more suspenseful when your health reaches critical levels.
 - *[to be added]* **Custom scoring and ranking system**
      - To keep the fun and casual aspect, this mod implements it's own take on a scoring and ranking system, mainly inspired by the system implemented in current day FNF!
      - Accuracy is now only an internal value, with it being only used to calculate gameplay-related events. Instead, your song clear percentage is determined by your note ratings!
      - Your song clear percentage then determines a Letter Ranking (such as F, D, C A, etc.) - inspired by Pizza Tower!
      - This makes it so that 100%ing a song is now ACTUALLY plausible, without requiring you to be a robot with complete accuracy!
      - Full Comboing a song isn't in vein though, as *something cool will happen when you sucessfully do so! Guess you'll have to wait and see~ >:3*
 - **And many more!**
      - Honestly like I will probably list all the features here at one point but I literally need to write a research paper dawg I- ADMJSOVGJDBSFB
