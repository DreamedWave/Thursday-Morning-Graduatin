-------------------------------- TO DO ----------------------------------

+ URGENT!!! Retaliation increase volume - Variegated Skylines reduce bass add mids
+ Revamp accuracy and rating system (take inspo from fnf update)
+ Turn off autopause when pressing BKSPC in game
+ Remove resujlts music in story mode
+ Urgent! Refine and add shit you planned to minigamestate!
+ Make loadingsubstate work with minigamestate
X Make popupscore fade out faster depending on the length of the spritegroup
X Add tiltshift blur to when pico shoots you
+ PopUpScore combo must start showing num only after combo reaches 5 or more
+ Popupscore looks like shit (lighten the darkening of the numbers, fix the velocityShit)
+ Camerashake affecting scroll lerp
+ Fix pissed gameover hi hats
- Alt + ENTER fullscreen still a problem - check flash btmap or FlxCamera or FlxCameraFrontEnd or something good heavens-
/ Something is wrong with playState - it lags when palying songs for some reason (maybe stop updating notes when they're not on screen idk)
^ The issue seems to be Low Power mode in my laptop - gotta test this on my old laptop lol
- Caching Optimizations (remove in some parts, fix in some others)
^ FIX cuz it still shows up after the numbers show when your combo breaks
- Autopause not working in playstate again
- Offset Tapper
^ For Base Ref, your offset is supposed to be 75 ms - and for the record, + is more delay, - is more earlier
^ Turn off noteHitSounds whenever offset is not equal to 0ms
+ To add to the above, GET NEW FNF INUT SYSTEMAND PUT IT HERE
- ADD GAME FEEL
^ Results screen must feel more impactful rather than just appearing with a buncha text
^ TAKE INSPO FROM FNF WEEKEND UPDATE RESULTS
^ skipsongintro anim (low priority)
^ if you can, add colour to scoretext
- menus need assets
- Improve mouse supoport (use scroll wheel rather than mouse for AlphabetMenus)
- Variegated Skylines 2nd part is a little rude - either make the notes distinguishable or like remove the trigger notes themselves
^ Just remove the trigger notes themselves

- URGENT! Songs mixing and charting
^ Reduce jacks in every song by replacing them with stairs (slowly introduce them throughout the weeks)
^ Up and beyond having too much jacks for beginners (reduce for all diffs - maybe remove the jacks in the first hald and rreduce in the 2nd half)
^ Sprouting Irritation having too many jacks and shit
/ FPS cap resetting to 126 for some goddamned reason when in playstate sometimes
^ Proposed fix, everytime player focuses on widnow, set fps like you did in options.hx
^ Also if you can, fix fps not matching the displayed fps at the top
- Week 3 and 4 cutscenes
/ Menu assets and sprites
- Rechart Sudden Confrontation and Sprouting Irritation
/ Fix Difficulty spikes (so far: Wk 1, Song 2-3)
- Improve Intimidation (playtest, itirate, add onto, flesh out)
- Remove the pitch edit on -village confirmMenuSnds
- increase scrollmenu volume by atleast 0.2
- Crash lol (FlxCamera.hx line 2053)
- Trans in showing for a brief moment when switching states even if skipped
^ move them into a separate script maybe? to make them do the velocity shit within the script rather than declaring them repeatedly in playstate

==============================LOW PRIORITY===============================

- Add a setting based on optimsed mode that just limits the visible stuff going on (check bianca's suggestions)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ THE DONE +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+ Set startSpeeding up to false and missyoffset to 0 when a note is a goodhit (use the if parent children foreach thing to do so for sus notes too)
+ figure out why tf selfser's miss notes aren't speeding up (prolly cause startspeeding up as a var hasnt been established in enemy note code yet)
+ Fix tutorial Camtweens being too slowwwwwww
+ Fix GUY getting SHOT in BOTLAY BRO HELP THIS POOR MAN
+ 'Early' and 'Late' are swapped in results screen
+ Make retaliation starting zoom crochet *2 rather than crochet *3
+ Skip Tutorial and R to gameover are instant presses, try adding an "are you sure" prompt or somethin
+ Issues with alt tab tweening
+ Fix conductor breaking when music resets (and curbeat is set to 0) ((it's because of the for... loop, maybe fix it by setting a function that sets everything back to normal)
+ Set resetbuttonfailsafetimer to 0.25 instead of 0.15
+ CamFollow is based on fps cap and not actual fps
+ GitarooHover plays when you die from skillIssue (missing notes)
+ SongPosBar updating on results screen for some reason???????????
+ Crash in fullscreen locks you unless you end task it (solution: make game smallscreen when crash happens)
+ Something in PlayState.hx (line 4479) causing a crash (check latest crash log) (OH IT'S CAUSED BY THE GAME ATTEMPTING TO SHAKE THE SONG POS CLOCK WHILE SONG POS IS OFF - THEREFORE CAUSING A CRASH BRO FIX THIS LMAO)
+ Change "so here's everything that went wrong" to "so here's what went wrong" in the crash log
+ Make Striking Tribulation HardDrop more hard (lol)
+ Gameover not centered (move guy by let's say 30 + px and the gameover text by let's say 10px)
+ Add isFocused variable in Main.hx and make it so that the mouse hover uopdate doesnt hover when game is out of focus
+ Videos cause crash (downscroll and optimized mode) (nvm it just crashes in general)
+ Make camGame and camHUD also bop in results screen? 
+ chart being null may be linked to the random cached sounds playing
+ check if the random cached sounds playing are the result of the musicbeatstate function
+ check week 1 if the whole midsongcutscene preventing dadIdle affects anything
+ Retaliation Crash (after curscene finishes)
^ [Notes above the top 3, not sure if the whole caching sound bug is fixed yet but oh well]
+ Eated Bullet SFX mixing and overall quality
+ Fix Main Menu cam follow

+ Distinguish Toggles from L/Rs in options menu
^ Toggles: Like this
^ L/Rs: <Like This>
^ [State Openers like this]
+ Fix file path of TMG
+ Intimidation Mechanic - Inspired by Decked Out 2's Clank Block
^ [Idea] for every 4 sections you fully FC, you gain 1 intimidation point, and you can press something to release that one point to 'intimidate' selfsert and make him miss 2 sections of his singing. You can get 10 intimidation points max - once you release all your 10 intimidation points all at once, something happens that gives you an advantage and can save your butt when you boutta die idk what it is ytet tho LMAO
+ Endsong not working again (so far for striking tribulation (i assume because of the chart being null - but do check other songs)
+ Tweak optionsounds (make them complement menutheme better)
+ Chart Striking Tribulation
+ game transitions out of playstate with the trans out despite ending with a video (causing weirdness lol (happens when scorescreen is off)
+ Turn on auto resize and align subtitles to left (when centersubtitles is off)
^ That or rename centersubtitles: on into '^ Subtitle style: compact/static'
^ Description idea: 
"Static - subtitles and it's background don't scale nor avoid overlapping with the healthbar. \n Compact - subtitles and it's background scale to fit in 1 line and stay above the healthbar."
+ Make it so that sus notes dont count for the total section notes hit for the intimid mechanic)
+ Hide cursor when game unfocuses
+ Change disagreement elastic lerp to x2.5 rathern than x3
+ Lower menu theme volumes (0.6? 0.5?)
^ Revert selfsert stage back to it's orig volume afterwards (set to 78 and then normalise)

+ Add tweens to the option music lowering in volume
+ Cursor not appearing in options after entering it thru disclaimer screen
+ Health not tweening again when you finish a song
+ Fix Uncentered subtitles (add to their x -100 or somethin)
+ Chrs not bopping in startcountdown()
+ increase optionsMenu music vol by 0.1
+ implement autopause shit in freeplay
X increase volume of menumusic atleast until 0.7
+ Remove mentions of technochan because it's insensitive to Technoblade and his family
+ Get thread caching shit from idie cross
+ Optimize game (cachingFunction at playstate start)
X Mixing of main menu theme - doesnt hit as hard as before (either increase climax or decrease intro)
+ add punctuation to funnysplash 'i was a bastard orphan'
X Fix chart autosave crashing
^ I just removed the load autosave button!!! LMAO!!!

+ Increase misc volume when lowhp
^ what?????
^ I assume i meant in retal. but uhhh ??? LMAO

+ Alphabet menus not working with mouse
^ proposed fix: add a square hitbox thing that's slightly bigger than the alphabet and as wide as your screen to the alphabet group
+ Retaliation mixing and lowhp difference
+ Campaign has weird black boxes ?????
+ Make it so that the temp folder doesnt delete everything (only important files like autosaves and replays)
