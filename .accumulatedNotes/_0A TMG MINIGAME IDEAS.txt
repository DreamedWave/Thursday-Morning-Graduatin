MINIGAME IDEAS I GOT WHILST WASHING FDISHES

- Make it like decked out 2 (YES including the cards and embers)
^ This encourages weeks to be replayed for their minigames
^ Not only allow replaying, but ENCOURAGE it.

- Minigames can only be played by finishing a week, not with a separate minigame tab
^ Each week has a set map, each getting more harder but giving more rewards than the last
- SECOND TO FINAL WEEK - PANDEOMONIUM LIKE MINIGAME

- STILL, allow song skipping
^ Give incentive to not skip songs (by giving a bonus, NOT by punishing those who skipped)

- Cards will remain the same mostly but will probably be capped at uncommon
^ Sneak, Stability, Ember Seeker, Moment of Clarity (rename these)
^ Clank Block, Hazard Block, currency multiplier, powerful one use card

Gameplay:
- Player will start with no cards
^ Tasked to get the '''artifact (thing to collect at the end of the map which in the lore is basic necessities cause in the story guy is being abused and lacks these but it's easier to internally refer to them as artifacts cause it's shorter than whatever this is lol)''' and return back to the starting room
^ Try your best to not be noisy or else it activates the escape sequence early
^ or wakes up enemies scattered across the map
^ Discover locked doors on your journey (hmm what is this for?)
^ Once returning to your room, collapse onto your bed and enter a "card purchasing shop" to make your next runs easier

- Max cards allowed should probably be lower than decked out 2 (it had 40, im probably gonna go with 20 or 10 cause i dont wanna make this a big thing)
^ card stacks would also probably be lower (sneaks in deacked out 2 are max 5, here it's probs just max 2-3 i think)

- Card shop and coin shop in decked out 2 are combined, no more coins nor embers, just one universal currency that's only for this run, could be use to purchase things that persist outside of that run (cards, keys)
^ OH, and yes you can buy keys for a very heavy price (probs the cost of a card) - these allow you to access the said locked rooms and get the secret treasure that affects the gameplay outside of the minigames!

- Dying to enemies would set you back by spawning you at the start of the room. Dying to the escape secquence though would make you restart the game losing all your progress in that game (collected artifact/ration, opened secret door, but not your cards, except this game's equivalent of moment of clarity)
^ make it punishing but not frustrating.


Treasures, currency, and rewards ideas
- The "artifact" at the end of the game are the basic necessities guy needs to have but must sneak by late at night to get it. I don't have a solid name for it yet but maybe something like "necessity" or "rations" (i really like the 2nd one actually)
^ Grants you a certain amount of currency to spend on the shop. Random like in decked out but not as big of a range as in it.

- The currency of the game should be called "vigor" (working title but i kinda like it). the "rations" give you "vigor", like how it's keeping you alive and giving you the capacity to think and get more "rations" more smartly (EH? YTOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE??? ITS AN ALLEGORY !!!!! FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE- ((it's a very serious topic and i want to actually portray it the best way i can so i hope im doing it justice)))
^ cannot go out of that game it's in. It's either you spend it or you lose it.
^ can purchase cards or keys. That's all I've thought of so far.

- The cards should probably still be called cards but i'm open to renaming it, maybe with the same theme as 'rations' and 'vigor'. They don't play randomly throughout the game like in decked out 2, I think it's best if they all play at the beginning. and you have to work with that limited resource. I'm open to negotiate this but like currently i'm not up for making a randomiser thingy for this.

- The keys still should be called key, but maybe with an adjective at the start like "mysterious" or "old" or something!!! (old key, mysterious key, pantry key, etc)
^ grants access to the:
^ The door must incite curiosity so that it gives the player the same decision to make as with players in decked out with cards and tomes.

- The secret treasure/collectibles. Should NEVER be accesed on the player's first run, up to them if they wanna spend their 'rations' for cards or a key to try for the 2nd run.
^ Lies at the end of a gauntlet thing that have lots of clank (and maybe enemies in the harder weeks)
^ Collecting it can grant a short term currency boost (just so they don't get bummed out taht it don't do anything) and a gameplay changer in the FNF section of the game
^ Should be called like "distant/bygone memory" cause ooo cool
^ Idk if i should allow recollection (for the sake of the currency bonus) but if i'm gonna do that, make it so that it just can serve as an extra currency bonus. if not, maybe block off the room or something (I'm leaning towards allowing it)


Secret Treasure Ideas:
- Part 1 Treasure, Tattered Notebook: Allows you to save at a song's halfway point. Not for all songs but for the longer songs it might seem useful.
- Part 2 Treasure, 
- Part 3 Treasure, 


CARD IDEAS:
- Shield card, stops you from taking any damage but causes clatter depending on how big the damage dealt is (insignificant damage, 0 clatter, hp draining damage, 1 clatter, room-resettingdamage, 3 clatter)


LEVEL IDEAS:
- Part 1, The House. Basically acts as the tutorial. Extend the hallways - make everything seem bigger. It's a little too small rn so make everything a lil bigger lol

- Part 2, The Gathering. Family have come to visit. Avoid meeting their gaze and get as much food as you can without your family seeing.

- Part 3, The Dark. The electricity bills were unpaid so you have to navigate the dark, avoiding clatter, while also checking your back. The horror level of the horror game basically.

- Part 4, The School. Lots of enemies - a mix of light and dark sections - Includes lockers/objects you can hide in. A timer starts counting down and you need to travel to a specific room number, then once the timer runs out and you aren't in the room yet, you will either get badly hurt or instakilled. This repeats throghout the map until you get the ration, which in this case, it will be a mad dash outta there.

- Part 5, The Woods. A linear level, where you need to go from Point A -> Point B, without needing to return back to Point A. This will be a stealth level with only 1 enemy (or atleast 1 main enemy and smaller enemies that could risk making clatter). There will be obstacles to avoid but the main focus of the stage should be the big bad. There will be no ration - just a final objective. During the final stretch, the man upstairs will spawn and will chase you.


ENEMY IDEAS:
- WhistleBlower, An enemy that lies dormant until alerted by clatter. Will chase you slower than your running speed but will speed up incrementally for every clatter you trigger (3 clatter = faster than player) [Introduced in Part 2]

- BackStabber, a enemy that follows you slowly in the dark. Have to rely on sound cues to detect. Acts like a non-insta kill bracken. Getting stabbed causes you to take damage, slowing you down until you heal, unless you have a shield card which causes clatter every time you take a hit. [Introduced in Part 2]

- Kiblitzer, an enemy that shoots 3 bullets before running away. Bullets can be deflected by parrying on time (Either by presshing shift or not moving. Red bullets require you to not move, while blue bullets require you to deflect) or using a shield card.

- GossipMaker, an enemy that appears in the classroom levels. They act like the manequins from that one hello neighbor minigame, except it's based on you interacting with the environment (internal reputation meter) - The only enemies to have diff personalities, some I can think of rn are the ff: [Normal - Roams around and goes to class like a normal student, only aggros towards you if you reach max low reputation | Bullies - Start pursuing you if your reputation is lower than 75%, in other cases they act like students but target to bully a random normal student. | Popular Ones [Working Name] - Can help you or detriment you - depending if you were nice to them or did them a favour or were bad to them cuz you needed to get into a locker, they influence your reputation and it can accumulate to either go up or down for a period of time (rate of which it increases/decreases similar to how baldi's speed starts fast but slowly slows down after time has passed.

- Mimicker, an enemy that spawns in a room and mirrors your movement (with delay). Difficulty determined by delay (how long it will take to copy your movement) and/or it being flipped/mirrored. Take heavy inspo from Badeline Celeste

- AttentionSeeker [Change name maybe], an emeny that demands your attention (facing it when it starts making noise) It's a random timer that ranges from 3-10 seconds (but it also depends as to how much there are on screen). When it doesn't get attention within that time, it will shriek, causing clatter, which in the final stage (which AttentionSeeker is in), will draw the attention of the main enemy of that stage. It will continue shrieking until it is squished by the main enemy - in other cases such as being in normal stages though, they shriek for 3-5 seconds, causing clatter - and they act like a normal living/moving clatterer. After shrieking, it will scuttle away for a set amount of time before they start following you again.

- Big bad [CHANGE THIS ON GODF PLEAED], Only appears on stage 6, is the """boss""" version of "The Man Upstairs", and acts like that one cool section from Little Nightmares. IM LOWBAT FLESH THIS OUT WRATER!!!
